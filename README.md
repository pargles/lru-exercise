## Quickstart
### Running it locally via shell and vanilla Python & virtualenv 
```shell script
# Clone the repo and run the following commands from the project root folder
# The following command will use whichever Python 3 version you have in your system, the project was initially developed on Python 3.8, but Python 3.9 or Python 3.7 should work as well 
# If you have trouble managing your local Python versions, consider using a tool like pipenv: https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
